# Release notes for Pymakr v2.24.x

This version of Pymakr brings a couple of features and a range of smaller fixes.

# <br>

## Feature Highlights

[New Home View](#new-home-view)

[Device Summary Page](#device-summary-page)

# <br>

## New Home View

- A new view has been added to the Pymakr tab. This view provides quick access to settings and documentation.
- The projects tree view has been moved to the Explorer tab by default. It can still be moved into other tabs, eg. Pymakr, but we feel this setting is a better default for most.

If there's anything you'd like to see in the new home view, please let us know.

# <br>

## Device Summary Page

The Device Summary Page provides a quick overview of connected devices, including a history of device actions.

To speed up troubleshooting, the page includes a `Create an issue on Github` which will create an issue template based on your device and system. We hope you never have to use it, but look forward to helping you, if you do.
